# README-Generator
make a README generator using a node app

## Goals 

The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate an understanding of Node but creating an app that will run in the console when called upon. To make this app, I had to use my knowledge of node to to like to require and export functions form one JavaScript file to another. I also used the 'inquirer' as an npm import to handle the logic behind asking the user prompts in the console we the app was called

## Usage 

To use this app, open the index.js and open the integrated terminal in VS code, once there first they the command " npm init -y " to initialize your index.js file as a node app. Then type in " npm i", if that doesn't work, try " npm i inquirer@8.2.4 ". Once you have done that, simply type " node index.js " to run the app. Doing this should bring up a series of prompts in the console, enter the information you desire to be in you read me in the corresponding prompts. After you have completed all of these steps, a README.md file should appear, open it in preview to see if it correctly entered the information. Use the file as a good base for your next projects README!!
